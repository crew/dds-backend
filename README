Prereqs
=======
- Python 2.4+
- python-pip
- python-setuptools

Setup
=====
in the dds directory, run

  sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

That'll download the right versions of software orwell depends on.
In the dds directory, add a file named 'local_settings.py'. Add

  DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'
  DATABASE_NAME = 'orwell.db'

to it. This specifies the sort of database orwell should use. In
this case, it'll use sqlite3 with a database file named orwell.db.
Check the django documentation if you want to use a different
database.

Running
=======
from the dds directory, run

  ./manage.py syncdb
  ./manage.py runserver
