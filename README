Prereqs
=======
- Python 2.4+
- python-pip
- python-setuptools

Setup
=====
in the dds directory, run

  sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

That'll download the right versions of software orwell depends on.
In the dds directory, add a file named 'local_settings.py'. Add

  DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'
  DATABASE_NAME = '/path/to/dds/orwell.db'
  MEDIA_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/media/'

to it. This specifies the sort of database orwell should use. In
this case, it'll use sqlite3 with a database file named orwell.db.
The full path to the database file must be given in order for
harvest to function properly when using orwell's settings file
(see the harvest README for details). DATABASE_NAME isn't
necessary if you use a database other than sqlite. Check the
django documentation for details on how to set up other databases.

Running
=======
from the dds directory, run

  ./manage.py syncdb
  ./manage.py runserver
